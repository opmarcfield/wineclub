Well wines like this 2021 Hautes-Cotes de Beaune from @bouchard_aine_fils challenge this. It is perfectly good everyday Chardonnay that won't break your bank. The nose has pear and green apple, the mouthfeel is oily with more green notes. Especially when the wine warms up the acidic notes subside and the round fruity notes take over. A good value for money.\n\nRating 4/5, great value for money.\n\n#bourgogne #burgundy #hautescotesdebeaune #cotedor #bouchardainefils",

This spesific Chardonnay comes from @lanzeracestate in the Stellenbosch and it has notes of pineapple, vanilla and oak.\n\nFun everyday wine that's easy to enjoy by itself.",

The aftertaste is quite short.\n\nEasy everyday wine.\n\nPhoto credits @lynlishphotography",

Great burgundy for a fair price.\n\nExcellent value for money.",

The pallet has lime and some sweetness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light but the intensity is good. A well made and fun wine.\n\nMore interesting than your average Riesling.",
