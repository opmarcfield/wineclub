Well wines like this 2021 Hautes-Cotes de Beaune from @bouchard_aine_fils challenge this. It is perfectly good everyday Chardonnay that won't break your bank. The nose has pear and green apple, the mouthfeel is oily with more green notes. Especially when the wine warms up the acidic notes subside and the round fruity notes take over. A good value for money.\n\nRating 4/5, great value for money.\n\n#bourgogne #burgundy #hautescotesdebeaune #cotedor #bouchardainefils",
